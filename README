NAME
    HTML::EP::Glimpse - A simple search engine using Glimpse

SYNOPSIS
      <!-- Put the following in your EP page: -->
      <!-- Load the Glimpse package: -->
      <ep-package name="HTML::EP::Glimpse">
      <!-- Run glimpse: -->
      <ep-glimpse-search>
      <!-- List the hits: -->
        <ep-list items=files item=f>
          <tr><td><a href="$f->url$">$f->title$</a></td>
        </ep-list>

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple search engine I wrote for the movie pages of a friend,
    Anne Haasis.

    It is based on HTML::EP, my embedded Perl system and Glimpse, the well
    known indexing system, as a backend.

INSTALLATION
    First of all, you have to install the latest version of HTML::EP, 0.20
    or later, and it's prerequisites. Next you have to install this package,
    HTML::EP::Glimpse. If you don't know how to install Perl packages, it's
    fairly simple: Fetch the required archives from any CPAN mirror, for
    example

      ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/HTML

    and then do, for example

      gzip -cd HTML-EP-0.20.tar.gz | tar xf -
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    It's even more simple, if you have the CPAN module available:

      perl -MCPAN -e shell
      install HTML::EP
      install HTML::EP::Glimpse

    While running perl Makefile.PL in the HTML::EP::Glimpse directory,
    you'll be prompted some questions. These are explained in the
    CONFIGURATION section below. See the CONFIGURATION manpage.

    Your web server must be ready for serving EP pages. See the HTML::EP
    docs for details of the web server configuration. the HTML::EP(3)
    manpage.

CONFIGURATION
    The module is configured at installation time when running perl
    Makefile.PL. However, you can repeat the configuration at any later time
    by running perl -MHTML::EP::Glimpse::Install -e Config.

    Configuration will create a module *HTML::EP::Glimpse::Config*, which
    holds a single hash ref with the following keys:

    install_html_files
        A TRUE (yes) value means, that the HTML examples will be copied to
        your web servers document root. This is recommended, unless you have
        an existing installation with own modifications in the HTML files.
        Of course you wouln't want to overwrite your own files.

    html_base_dir
        Base directory, where you put your HTML files to. The default is
        /home/httpd/html/Glimpse, which is fine on a Red Hat Linux box.

    vardir
        A directory, where the web server is allowed to create files, in
        particular your preferences and the Glimpse index. By default the
        subdirectory admin/var of the base directory is choosen.

    httpd_user
        The UID under which your web server is running CGI binaries. The
        vardir must have read, execute and write permissions for this user.
        The default is *nobody*, which is fine on a Red Hat Linux box again.

    glimpse_path
    glimpseindex_path
        Path of the *glimpse* and *glimpseindex* binaries.

  The Preferences

    All other settings are fixed via the Web browser. Assuming your base
    directory is accessible via

      http://localhost/Glimpse/

    point your browser to

      http://localhost/Glimpse/admin/index.ep

    and enter the preferences page. The following items must be entered
    here:

    Web servers root directory
        This is your web servers home directory, for example

          /home/httpd/html

        on a Red Hat Linux box.

    Directories being indexed
        Usually you just put the value / here, because you want your whole
        web server being indexed. However, if you want restrict the index to
        some directories, enter them here. For example, if you have a manual
        in /manual and want to index the manual directory only, then enter

          /manual

        The directory names are relative to the servers root directory.

    Directories being excluded
        If you don't want your whole directory tree being indexed, you can
        also exclude some directories. For example, there's not much sense
        in indexing the Glimpse directory, so I usually enter

          /Glimpse

        here.

    Suffixes of files being indexed
        Of course you don't want all files being indexed. For example,
        there's not much sense in indexing GIF's or JPEG's. By default only
        files with the extensions *.htm* and *.html* are indexed. If you
        want your EP files being indexed as well, add a *.ep*. Likewise you
        might want to add *.php* for PHP3 files or *.txt* for text files.

  Running glimpseindex

    As soon as you modified your preferences, you should create an index.
    This is done by returning to the admin menu and calling the index page.

    The same procedure should be repeated each time you modify your HTML
    files. If this is happening frequently, you might prefer using a cron
    job, for example

      su - nobody -c "/usr/bin/glimpseindex -b -H $vardir -X"

    with $vardir being the vardir from above. Note that your job shouln't
    run as root, unless you want to disable a manual recreation via the web
    browser.

  Configuring for multiple virtual servers or multiple directories

    So far configuration is fine, but can you use multiple instances of
    HTML::EP::Glimpse on one machine? Of course you can!

    It is quite simple: Just copy the base directory to another location.
    Then create a subdirectory admin/lib/HTML/EP/Glimpse of the new base
    directory. Create a new configuration by running

      cd $basedir/admin/lib/HTML/EP/Glimpse
      perl -MHTML::EP::Glimpse::Install -e Config Config.pm

    That's it!
